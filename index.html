        <p>Closures are confusing because they are an “invisible” concept.</p> <br>

        <P>When you use an object, a variable, or a function, you do this intentionally. <br>
        You think: “I’m gonna need a variable here,” and add it to your code.</P> <br>
        
        <P> Closures are different. By the time most people approach closures, they have <br> already used them unknowingly many times — and it is likely that this is true for <br> yourself, too. 
        So learning closures is less about understanding a new concept and <br> more about recognizing something you have already been doing for a while.</p>

    <article>
        <h1>tl;dr</h1>
            <p>You have a closure when a function accesses variables defined outside of it.</p>
            
            <p> example, this code snippet contains a closure:</p>
            <code id="cd">
                let users = ['Alice', 'Dan', 'Jessica']; <br>
                let query = 'A';<br>
                let user = users.filter(user => user.startsWith(query));<br>
            </code>
            <p>Notice how user => user.startsWith(query) is itself a function. <br> It uses the query variable. But the query variable is defined outside of that function. That’s a closure.</p>

    <article>
    <p><b> You can stop reading here, if you want.</b> The rest of this article approaches closures in a different way. <br> Instead of explaining what a closure is, it will walk you through the process of discovering closures — like the first programmers did in the 1960s.</p>

        <h1>
            Step 1: Functions Can Access Outside Variables
        </h1>
        <br>
        <p>To understand closures, we need to be somewhat familiar with variables and <br>
            functions. In this example, we declare the food variable inside the eat function:
        </p>
        <code id="cd">
            function eat() { <br>
                let food = 'cheese'; <br>
                console.log(food + ' is good'); <br>
              } <br>
              eat(); // Logs 'cheese is good' 
        </code>
        <p> But what if we wanted to later change the food variable outside of the eat function? <br> To do this, we can move the food variable itself out of our function into the top level:</p>
        <code id="cd">
            let food = 'cheese'; // We moved it outside <br>
            function eat() { <br>
            console.log(food + ' is good');
        </code>
        <p>This lets us change the food “from the outside” any time that we want to:</p>
        <code id="cd">
            eat(); // Logs 'cheese is good' <br>
            food = 'pizza'; <br>
            eat(); // Logs 'pizza is good'<br>
            food = 'sushi'; <br>
            eat(); // Logs 'sushi is good'
        </code>
        <p>In other words, the food variable is no longer local to our eat function, but our eat <br>  
        function nevertheless has no trouble accessing it. <b> Functions can access variables <br>
        outside of them.</b> Stop for a second and make sure that you have no problem with <br> 
        this idea.Once it has settled comfortably in your brain, move to the second step.</p>

        <h1>Step 2: Wrapping Code in a Function Call</h1> <br>
        <p>Let’s say we have some code:</p>
        <code id="cd">
            /* A snippet of code */
        </code>
        <p>It doesn’t matter what that code does. But let’s say that we want to run it twice.</p>
        <p>One way to do it would be to copy and paste it:</p>
        <code id="cd">
            /* A snippet of code */ <br>
            /* A snippet of code */
        </code>
        <p>Another way to do it would be to use a loop:</p>
        <code id="cd">
            for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) { <br>
            /* A snippet of code */
            }
        </code>
        <p>
            The third way, which we’re particularly interested in today, is to wrap it in a function:
        </p>
        <code id="cd">
            function doTheThing() { <br>
                /* A snippet of code */ <br>
              } <br>
              doTheThing(); <br>
              doTheThing();
        </code>
        <p>Using a function gives us the ultimate flexibility because we can run this function <br> any number of times, at any time — and from anywhere in our program.</p>
        <p>In fact, <b> we can even call our new function only once, if we wanted to:</p> </b>
        <code id="cd">
            function doTheThing() { <br>
                /* A snippet of code */ <br>
              } <br>
              doTheThing();
        </code>
        <p>Notice how the code above is equivalent to the original code snippet:</p>
        <code id="cd">/* A snippet of code */</code>
        <p>In other words, if we take some piece of code, <b> “wrap” that code in a function, and <br> 
            then call that function exactly once, we haven’t changed what that code is doing.</b> <br> 
            There are some exceptions to this rule which we will ignore, but generally saying <br>
            this should make sense. Sit on this idea until your brain feels comfortable with it.

    <article>
        <h1>Step 3: Discovering Closures</h1> <br>
        <p>We have traced our way through two different ideas:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Functions can access variables defined outside of them.</li>
                <li>Wrapping code in a function and calling it once doesn’t change the result.</b> </li>
        <p>Now let’s see what happens if we combine them.</p>        
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>We’ll take our code example from the first step:</p>
        <code id="cd">let food = 'cheese'; <br>
            function eat() { <br>
              console.log(food + ' is good'); <br>
            } <br>
            eat();</code>
        <p>Then we’ll wrap this whole example into a function, which we’re going to call once:</p>
        <code id="cd">function liveADay() { <br>
            let food = 'cheese'; <br>
            function eat() { <br>
              console.log(food + ' is good'); <br>
            } <br>
            eat(); <br>
          } <br>
          liveADay();</code> 
          <p>Read both snippets one more time and make sure that they are equivalent.</p>
          <p>This code works! But look closer. Notice the eat function is inside the liveADay <br>
            function.Is that even allowed? Can we really put a function inside another function?</p>
          <p>There are languages in which a code structured this way is not valid. For example, <br>
             this code is not valid in the C language (which doesn’t have closures). This means <br>
              that in C, our second conclusion isn’t true — we can’t just take some arbitrary piece <br>
             of code and wrap it in a function. But JavaScript doesn’t suffer from that limitation.</p>  
          <p>Take another good look at this code and notice where food is declared and used:</p>   
          <code id="cd">
            function liveADay() { <br>
                let food = 'cheese'; // Declare `food` <br>
                function eat() { <br>
                  console.log(food + ' is good'); // Read `food` <br>
                } <br>
                eat(); <br>
              } <br>
              liveADay();
          </code>
    </article>
    <br>
    <article>
        <p>Let’s go through this code together — step by step. First, we declare the liveADay <br>
            function at the top level. We immediately call it. It has a food local variable. It also <br>
            contains an eat function. Then it calls that eat function. Because eat is inside of <br>
            liveADay, it “sees” all of its variables. This is why it can read the food variable.  
        </p> <br>
    </b>This is called a closure.</b>
    <p> <b> We say that there is a closure when a function (such as eat) reads or writes a variable (such as food) <br> 
        that is declared outside of it (such as in liveADay).</b></p>
        <p>Take some time to re-read this, and make sure you can trace this in the code.</p> <br>
        <p>Here is an example we’ve introduced in the tl;dr section:</p>
        <code id="cd">let users = ['Alice', 'Dan', 'Jessica']; <br>
            let query = 'A'; <br>
            let user = users.filter(user => user.startsWith(query));</code>
            <p>It may be easier to notice the closure if we rewrite it with a function expression:</p>
        <code id="cd">
            let users = ['Alice', 'Dan', 'Jessica']; <br>
            // 1. The query variable is declared outside <br>
            let query = 'A'; <br>
            let user = users.filter(function(user) { <br>
                // 2. We are in a nested function <br>// 3. And we read the query variable (which is declared outside!) <br>
                return user.startsWith(query); <br>
            });
        </code>
        <p>Whenever a function accesses a variable that is declared outside of it, we say it is a <br>
            closure. The term itself is used a bit loosely. Some people will refer to the nested <br>
            function itself as “the closure” in this example. Others might refer to the technique <br>
            of accessing the outside variables as the closure. Practically, it doesn’t matter.
        </p>

    <br>
    <article>
        <h1>A Ghost of a Function Call</h1> <br>
        <p>Closures might seem deceptively simple now. This doesn’t mean they’re without <br>
            their own pitfalls. The fact that a function may read and write variables outside has <br>
            rather deep consequences if you really think about it. For example, this means that <br>
            these variables will “survive” for as long as the nested function may be called:</p>
        <code id="cd">
            function liveADay() { <br>
                let food = 'cheese'; <br>
                function eat() { <br>
                  console.log(food + ' is good'); <br>
                } <br>
                // Call eat after five seconds <br>
                setTimeout(eat, 5000); <br>
              } <br>
              liveADay();
        </code>
        <p>Here, food is a local variable inside the liveADay() function call. It’s tempting to <br>
             think it “disappears” after we exit liveADay, and it won’t come back to haunt us.</p>
        <p>
            However, inside of liveADay we tell the browser to call eat in five seconds. And eat <br>
             reads the food. <b>So the JavaScript engine needs to keep the food variable <br>
              from that particular liveADay() call available until eat has been called.</b> 
        </p>
        <p>
            In that sense, we can think of closures as of “ghosts” or “memories” of the past <br>
             function calls. Even though our liveADay() function call has long finished, its <br>
              variables must continue to exist for as long as the nested eat function may still <br> 
              be called. Luckily, JavaScript does that for us, so we don’t need to think about it.
            </p>

    <article>
        <h1>Why “Closures”?</h1> <br>
        <p>
            Finally, you might be wondering why closures are called that way. The reason is <br>
            mostly historical. A person familiar with the computer science jargon might say that  <br>
            an expression like user => user.startsWith(query) has an “open binding”.In <br>
            other words, it is clear from it what the user is (a parameter), but it is not clear what <br> 
            query is in isolation. When we say “actually, query refers to the variable declared <br>
             outside”, we are “closing” that open binding. In other words, we get a closure.
        </p>
        <p>Not all languages implement closures. For example, in some languages like C,it is <br> 
            not allowed to nest functions at all. As a result, a function may only access its own <br> 
            local variables or global variables, but there is never a situation inwhich it can <br> 
            access a parent function’s local variables. Naturally, that limitation is painful.</p>

        <p>There are also languages like Rust which implement closures, but have a separate <br>
            syntax for closures and regular functions. So if you want to read a variable from <br>
            outside a function, you would have to opt into that in Rust. This is because under <br> 
            the hood, closures may require the engine to keep the outer variables (called “the <br> 
            environment”) around even after the function call. This overhead is acceptable in <br> 
            JavaScript, but it can be a performance concern for the very low-level languages.</p>
            <p>And with that, I hope you can get a closure on the concept of closures!</p>
